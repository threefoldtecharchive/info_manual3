# Overview

![](./img/websitetool.jpeg)  

**ThreeFold Website Tool** is a customized open-source Zola-based web deployment framework and static website template repository that is available for anyone to use.

At ThreeFold, we utilized Website Tool to deploy all of our web presences. For example, [**www.threefold.io**](https://threefold.io).

## What is Zola Framework?
[**Zola**](https://www.getzola.org/) is a static site generator (SSG), similar to Hugo, Pelican, and Jekyll (for a comprehensive list of SSGs, please see Jamstack). It is written in Rust and uses the Tera template engine, which is similar to Jinja2, Django templates, Liquid, and Twig. Content is written in CommonMark, a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown.

While you can also publish a static website using Zola alone, we at ThreeFold have customized the framework and created a static website template that makes it even easier for anyone to build a website by simply cloning template and fill it with their own website content.
