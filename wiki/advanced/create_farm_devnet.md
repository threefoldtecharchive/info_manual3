# Creating a Farm on TFChain Devnet

## Step 1: Copy types to clipboard

## Step 2: browse to Polkadot UI

Open https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.dev.grid.tf#/settings/developer in your browser.

Paste the types in in the box and hit `save`

## Step 3: Create an account

Open https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.dev.grid.tf#/accounts in your browser, 

click `Add account`, take note of the seed. Click on the `Advanced creation options` arrow, and select keypair crypto type: `Edwards(ed25519, alternative)`

### Step 3.b: Install PolkadotJS extension and import your newly created account

Go to: https://polkadot.js.org/extension/ and add this extension to your browser.

Open the extension, click the + sign (on the right top) and select `Restore account from backup JSON file`, drag the saved json file in there and proceed with setup.

Once completed, you can sign any extrinsic to create a twin / farm with your extension.

## Step 4: Fund your account

On the same page, on the left top, hover over `Account` button and click on `Transfer`. First select account `Alice` and secondly select your newly created account from the list. Send any amount to your account (these are just tokens to play around with, they hold no real value).

## Step 5: Create a Twin

Open https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.dev.grid.tf#/extrinsics in your browser 

and select your account from the list. Next, select `tfgridModule` -> `createTwin(ip)` from the list.

Fill in your [Yggdrasil](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go) IPV6. And click on submit transaction and sign it with your account.

## Step 6: Create a Farm

Devnet: 
Open https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.dev.grid.tf#/extrinsics in your browser

and select your account from the list. Next, select `tfgridModule` -> `createFarm(..)` from the list.

Fill in a name, select a certification type and leave `country_id` and `city_id` to 0. You can, if you want, set the country/city id values to a value from the [GraphQL Explorer](https://graphql.dev.grid.tf/graphql). 

To find a country or city you can query all the available countries and cities in graphql.

Optionally you can also provide public ips on your farm.

## Step 7: query twin ID and Farm ID

### Query twin

Open https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.dev.grid.tf#/chainstate

and select `tfgridModule` -> scroll all the way down to `twinIdByAccountID(accountID):u32` and select your account ID from the list. Hit the PLUS symbol and you should see your twin ID.

### Query farm:

Open https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.dev.grid.tf#/chainstate

and select `tfgridModule` -> scroll to `farmIdByName(bytes):u32` and search your farm ID based on your farm name. Hit the PLUS symbol and you should see your farm ID.

As farm id you need to specify your farm id.
