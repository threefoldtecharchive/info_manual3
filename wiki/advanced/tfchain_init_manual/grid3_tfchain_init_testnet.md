## TFChain on Testnet

!!!include dashboard_portal_home

For deployments, you'll need a TF-Chain account and a twin registered. You'll need both your mnemonic phrase and TwinID to pass to the Terraform plugin.

> NOTE: We are working hard to have the runtime environments running in a fully stable manner. However, as we're still in test phase, it is recommended not to send too many tokens to TF-Chain for testing, until a further notice.

#### Important notes:

- You must choose `ed25519` as the "crypto type" when setting up your account
- The testnet used real TFT, which can be transferred from Stellar over the Stellar-Substrate Bridge (url TO DO).
- The guide advises to find your twin ID by checking the `twinID()` method. However, this will only correspond to your ID until a new twin is created and the value is incremented. To make sure you're seeing the ID associated with your account, use `twinIdByAccountID(AccountId)` instead, and select your account name from the drop down.
