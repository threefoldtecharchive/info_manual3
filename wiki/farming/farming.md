# Farming

This section covers how to register a farm and boot a node on ThreeFold Grid version 3. For information on compatible hardware and rewards, please see [farming](!@threefold:farming_intro) on the main wiki.

*Note that if you are already farming on Grid 2, you will need to register a new farm for Grid 3.*

To get started, [create your farm](create_farm).
